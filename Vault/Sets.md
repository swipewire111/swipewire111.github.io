### sets

Sets:: are collections as a well defined and disticnt objects, they are genrally denoted by capital letters and the elements inside of them are generally denoted by lowercase letters
<!--SR:!2023-11-27,139,297-->
### Ways of representing a set
#### Sets can be represented in two ways
 Roster form of representing sets::Where all the elements of the set are listed out
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,143,297-->
Set builder form of representing sets:: where a certain rule, or property, gives us the elements of the set
<!--SR:!2023-08-08,50,257-->

---
 Cardinal numbers::These numbers, denoted by n(A) where A is the set that the cardinality function is operating on, returns the value of the number of elements inside of the set
<!--SR:!2023-08-19,61,290-->

---

### Types of sets
 Null set:: represented by the greek letter phi $\phi$ , but not phi inside of curly brackets, in which case that would count as a set.
<!--SR:!2023-08-13,55,297-->

Singleton set:: as the name suggests it is a set that contains only a single element
<!--SR:!2023-08-16,58,297-->

Finite set::The set contains a finite number of elements, IE, the cardinality of the set is a finite number
<!--SR:!2023-08-21,49,277-->

 Infinite set:: The set contains an infinite number of elements, IE the cardinality of the set is infinite
<!--SR:!2023-08-16,58,297-->

 Equal sets: when two sets A and B have the exact same elements inside of them, they are called equal sets

 Equivalent sets:: When two sets A and B contain the exact same **number** of elements, they are called equivalent sets
<!--SR:!2023-08-15,57,297-->

 Universal set:: A set that contains all the possible elements that are related to the current discussion is called a universal set, denoted by U
<!--SR:!2023-08-17,59,297-->

Subset:: `A` is considered a subset of `B` if all the elements of Set `A` are in set `B`
<!--SR:!2025-06-15,585,317-->

 Superset:: `B` is considered the superset of `A` if all the elements in set `A` are in set `B`
<!--SR:!2023-08-20,48,270-->

Power set:: The set that contains all the possible subset of a given set
<!--SR:!2023-08-15,57,297-->

---
### intervals
 Open interval:: Represented by parenthesis, like `(a,b)` where all the values from in between "a" and "b" are taken, but not "a" and "b" themselves are included
<!--SR:!2023-09-03,55,270-->

Closed interval:: Represented by square brackets by `[a,b]` , where all the values from in between a and b are as well as a and b themselves are included
<!--SR:!2023-08-19,47,277-->

---
### Operations on sets
Union of sets:: The intersection of sets is represented by $A \cup B$  where the resultant set contains all the elements of set A and B, combined. 
<!--SR:!2023-08-06,48,257-->

Intersection of sets:: The intersection of sets is represented by $A \cap B$ , where the reslutant set contains only the elements that occur in both A *and* B
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,140,297-->

 Difference of two sets:: Represented by `A-B` where you take out all the elements that `A` has in common with `B` 
<!--SR:!2023-12-04,146,297-->

 Symmetric difference of two sets:: represented by $A \Delta B$   Where You take the union of `A` and `B` and you remove all the elements that they have in common with each other 
<!--SR:!2023-08-21,63,290-->

 Complement of a set:: A complement of a set, also called a prime of a set is denoted by the A' where A' contains all the elements that are in the universal set, besides the elements that are in the original set A
<!--SR:!2023-11-29,141,290-->

 Disjoint sets:: When $A \cap B = \phi$  then sets are called disjoint, IE, they have no elements in common
<!--SR:!2023-08-22,50,270-->

### Laws of algebra on sets
 Commutative law:: $A \cup B = B \cup A$ and $A \cap B = B \cap A$
<!--SR:!2023-08-09,51,257-->

 Associative law :: $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$ and $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$
<!--SR:!2023-08-12,54,297-->

 Distributive law :: $A\cup(B\cap C) = (A\cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$ and $A\cap (B\cup C) = (A\cap B)\cup (B\cap C)$
<!--SR:!2023-07-24,35,210-->

 De-morgan Law:: $(A \cup B)' = A' \cap B'$ and $(A \cap B)' = A' \cup B'$
<!--SR:!2023-09-06,57,277-->

$A-(B\cup C)$ :: $(A-B) \cap (A-C)$
<!--SR:!2023-07-18,7,237-->

  $A-(B\cap C)$ = $(A-B) \cup (A-C)$

### some important results on cardinality of sets

$n(A\cup B)=$ ::$n(A) +n(b) - n(A\cap B)$
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,142,297-->
  $n(A-B)=$ :: $n(A) - n(A\cap B)$
<!--SR:!2023-11-12,124,257-->
$n(A \cup B \cup C )=$ :: $n(A) \cup n(B) \cup n(C) -n(A\cap B) - n(A\cap C) - n(B\cap C) + n(A \cap B \cap C)$
<!--SR:!2023-11-26,138,297-->
  Number of elements in exactly two of the sets of A, B, C :: $n(A\cup B) + n(A\cup C) + n(B \cup C) -3n(A\cup B\cup C)$
<!--SR:!2023-08-07,49,257-->
Number of elements in exactly one set from A, B, C :: $n(A) + n(B) + n(C) -2n(A\cap B) - 2n(A\cap C) - 2n(B\cap C) + 3n(A \cap B \cap C)$
<!--SR:!2023-12-10,134,257-->

### The wavy curve method
The wavy curve method :: find the zeroes and the poles of the function, then arrange them on a number line in an ascending order, the right-hand-most side will always be positive, now depending on the exponent of the zero, change the sign if the power is odd, and leave the power unchanged if its even, find all the intervals that satisfy the linear inequality and then make the sets
