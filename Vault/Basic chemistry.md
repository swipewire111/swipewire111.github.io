### Daltons atomic theory
#### Postulates of daltons atomic hypothesis
- ##### Each element is made out of extremely small particles called atoms that take part in a chemical equation, 
- ##### all atoms of an element are identical but atoms of different elements are different, atoms of different elements have different properties and have different masses, 
- ##### atoms of elements combine to form molecules and atoms of different elements combine to form molecules, 
- ##### atoms are indestructible, they neither can be created nor destroyed, i
- ##### n a given compound the relative number of atoms is always the same, and the kind of atoms is constant.

### Modern atomic theory
- #### Postulates of the modern atomic theory
	-  The atom is no longer considered indivisible
	-  Atoms of same elements may have different masses, IE - isotopes
	-  Atoms of different elements may have same masses, IE - isobars
	-  Atom is no longer considered indestructible, where in many nuclear reactions where the nuclei of atoms fuse or split, and then release $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ rays
	-  Atoms do not always combine in simple whole number ratios

### Characteristics of gasses
- #### characteristics of gasses :: 
<!--SR:!2023-09-24,57,250-->
	- ##### gasses and their mixtures are always homogeneous in composition
	- ##### gasses have very low density due to their negligible intermolecular forces
	- ##### gasses have infinite expansibility and high compression-ability
	- #####  gasses exert pressure
	- ##### gasses posses high diffusibility
	- ##### gasses do not have definite shape and volume like liquids
	- ##### gasses have the highest intermolecular kinetic energy
	- ##### gasses have molecules that impact each other and the walls of the container
	- ##### gasses can be liquefied when subjected to low temperatures and high pressures
	- ##### thermal energy of gasses > their intermolecular forces of attraction
	- ##### obey certain gas laws

#### Ideal gas equation :: pressure * volume  = Number of moles * Universal gas constant * Temperature

### Laws of chemical combinations 
- Law of conservation of mass :: In a chemical reaction, matter can neither be created nor destroyed.
-  Law of definite proportions :: the same chemical compound will consist of the same elements in the same proportions, no matter the source they originate from
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,15,270-->
-  Law of multiple proportions :: An element may form more than one compound with the same element, in that case the masses of the other elements in the form a simple ratio
-  Gay Lussac's law of gaseous volumes:: at the same temperature and pressure, the reactants and products are related to each other via integers
<!--SR:!2023-09-30,63,270-->
-  Avogadro's law:: The volume of a gas is directly proportional to its number of moles
<!--SR:!2023-07-19,1,210-->
