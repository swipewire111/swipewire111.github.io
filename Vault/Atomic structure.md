### waves and electromagnetic radiation
-  What is a wave :: a wave is a periodic disturbance in a space or medium that involves elastic displacement of material particles or a periodic change in some physical quantity. Wave motion represents the propagation of a periodic disturbance carrying energy
-  James Maxwell's suggestion on electromagnetic radiation :: When an electrically charged particle is accelerated, alternating electric and magnetic fields are produced and transmitted
<!--SR:!2023-07-14,3,250-->
-  Characteristics of a wave :: Waves are characterized by their wavelength $(\lambda)$ , Frequency $\nu$, and Velocity $c$, All electromagnetic waves travel with the same velocity, ie, $3*10^8$
	-  Wavelength $\lambda$ :: The distance between two consecutive crests or troughs, is called the wavelength, Denoted by the greek letter lambda $\lambda$, its a physical quantity measured in cm, m, or angstrom.
<!--SR:!2023-07-14,3,250-->
	-  Frequency $\nu$ :: The number of waves that pass through a given point in unit time is also called the frequency of the wave, denoted by the greek letter nu $\nu$ the unit if frequency is hertz $(hz)$ or Cycles per second $(cps)$
<!--SR:!2023-10-03,66,290-->
	-  Velocity :: the distance covered by a wave in unit time is the velocity of a wave
<!--SR:!2023-08-15,28,290-->
	-  Wave number $(\bar\nu)$ :: wave number,  Is the number of waves per unit area, it is the reciprocal of wavelength $\bar\nu=\frac{1}{\lambda}$ 
	-  Amplitude :: Represented by the letter "$a$", gives us the height of a crest or the depth of a trough, This value gives us the intensity of radiation
	-  Time period :: Denoted by "$T$", This value gives us the amount of time required for a wave to complete one cycle
- #### Various electromagnetic waves and their characteristics
	- Radio waves :: $3*10^{14}-3*10^7$ angstrom, $10^5-10^9$ hertz ,source - High frequency AC current. Used for signal transmission

<!--SR:!2023-09-04,37,250-->
	-  infrared radiation :: $6*10^6-7600$ angstrom, $5*10^{11}-3.95*10^{14}$ hertz, source - incandescent object, used for heating
	-  Visible light ::$7600-3800$ angstrom $3.95*10^{14}-7*10^{14}$ hertz, source - electric bulbs or sunlight, used for illumination
<!--SR:!2023-09-02,35,250-->
	- Ultraviolet radiation :: $3800-150$ angstrom $7.9*10^{14}-2*10^{16}$ hertz, source - Sun rays, mercury vapor - used for germicidal lamps
<!--SR:!2023-07-14,3,250-->
	- X Rays :: $150-0.1$ angstrom, $2*10^{16}-3*10^{19}$ hertz Source - Cathode rays striking a metal plate, uses - Medical pictures, material testing

### Particle nature of EMR
- #### While the wave nature of EMR explains many phenomena like diffraction and interference, but fails to explain black body radiation and photoelectric effect
- Black body radiation, and black bodies:: A black body is a body that absorbs and radiates all types of radiation, these bodies show the change of radiation radiated while heated, showing the color change as dull red $\to$ red $\to$ white $\to$ blue, this cannot be satisfactorily explained by the wave nature of EMR

## Planck's quantum theory
### The black body behavior was, explained by the physicist Max Planck.
-  What are quantum :: Quantum are the discrete packets of energy that the atoms or molecules lose or gain energy in
- What is the energy of a quantum proportional to :: The energy of a quantum is proportional to its frequency, given as $E=h\nu$ where $h$ is a proportionality constant called Planck's constant [[important constants]], energy is always lost or gained in integral multiples of $h\nu$ like $2h\nu$ or $3h\nu$
- #### Planck was unable to give an explanation this discrete relation of energy and wavelength, Einstein gave us this explanation for this quantized nature of light, by his explanation of the photoelectric effect
	- The photoelectric effect :: When a light of certain frequency strikes the surface of a metal, electrons are ejected from the surface of the metal, The phenomena of ejection of electrons from the surface of a metal under incident radiation , is called the photo electric effect
	- ##### According to the wave theory , the number of electrons and their energy depends on the intensity of incident light, but it is found that only the number electrons depends on the intensity of the incident light
	- Work Function of a metal :: Also called the threshold frequency of a metal is the minimum frequency of incident light for photoelectric effect occurs `under which the photoelectric effect does not occur` Calculated by $E=h\nu_0$ where $\nu_0$ is The threshold frequency, IE the work function.
<!--SR:!2023-09-30,63,270-->
### Kinetic energy of ejected electrons
- #### As all incident light will have the energy as $h\nu$ and it takes $h\nu_0$ energy to eject an electron from the surface of a metal, thus the maximum energy of a photoelectron is directly proportional transferred energy on the electron is
	- Einstein's equation for photoelectron ::
