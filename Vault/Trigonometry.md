### The trigonometric circle/ unit circle
Polar coordinate system:: (x,y), will correspond to $(\alpha Cos(\theta), \alpha Sin(\theta))$ where $\alpha$ is the distance of the point from the origin and $\theta$ is the angle that the line created by joining the origin and the point together, forms with the positive x axis.

### The radian system

A radian:: Is the degree of openness that two equal lines create when the arc formed by those lines is equal to their length, IE, the openness when the length of the arc formed is equal to the radii.

1 radian in degree :: 180$\degree$ 
1 degree in radian :: $\frac{1}{180}$
