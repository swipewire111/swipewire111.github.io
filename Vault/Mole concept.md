### Masses of substances
 Atomic mass :: The mass of an atom compared to the mass of $\frac{1}{12}$ of a carbon-12 isotope, 
<!--SR:!2023-08-13,26,290-->

Average atomic mass :: due to the existence of multiple isotopes of atoms, there is no homogenous atomic weight, rather the average of all atomic weights is taken, where $a$ and $b$ are the atomic weights, and $m:n$ is the ratio to which they occur naturally, $\frac{m*a+n*b}{m+n}$ is the average atomic mass.
<!--SR:!2023-07-15,4,270-->

GAM, gram atomic mass :: where the atomic mass of an element is taken as a single unit, or 1 GAM
<!--SR:!2023-07-15,4,270-->

Molecular mass :: Is the mass of a molecule relative to $\frac{1}{12}$ of a carbon-12 atom

GMM :: When the mass of a single molecule is taken as a gram, it is a GMM
<!--SR:!2023-10-01,64,290-->

1 mole of substance :: 1 mole of substance is $6.02217*10^{23}$ amount of that particle, thus amole of substance is the number of substance after multiplying it with Avogadro's number($N_A$) 
<!--SR:!2023-08-13,26,290-->

mole to volume conversion for gasses :: 1 mol = 22.4 litres of gas

mole to mass conversion :: number of moles * Molecular mass
<!--SR:!2023-10-04,67,290-->

Empirical formula :: Simplest whole number ratio of the elements in a chemical compound
<!--SR:!2023-07-15,4,270-->

% Composition of an element in a compound :: The % of an element in a compound by mass.
<!--SR:!2023-07-14,3,250-->

Chemical reaction :: It's the process where two or more compounds interact to break old chemical bonds and from new chemical bonds
<!--SR:!2023-07-14,3,250-->

Chemical equation ::  on a face level all chemical equations just show us the reactants and their products, but if you balance the reaction they also give the information of the molar ratio of the reactants and products and also the direction of the reaction. 
<!--SR:!2023-10-02,65,290-->

The attributes of a balanced chemical reactions :: -
<!--SR:!2023-07-15,4,270-->
-  Must contain the same amount of atoms of each element on the left hand and the right hand side of the equation 
-  Should follow the law of charge conservation on both the sides
-  Physical state of the reagents must be given inside brackets
-  All reagents must be written in their standard molecular form and not as atoms
-  The coefficients must give the molar ratios of the reagents

### Some definitions
-  limiting reagents :: The reagent that is first consumed in a chemical reaction is called the limiting reagents
<!--SR:!2023-10-06,69,290-->
-  % excess :: The amount of reactant left after all of the limiting reagent is completely consumed 
-  % yield :: Practically, there will be a difference in the amount of physical product produced and the calculated, theoretical product produced
-  POAC (principle of atomic conservation) :: for all chemical reactions besides nuclear reactions, the number of atoms and moles will always remain conserved

---
### Equivalent concept
-  Equivalent weight :: The weight of an element which would combine or displace, by weight, 1 part hydrogen,  8 parts oxygen, or 35.5 parts chlorine, equivalent wt. atomic weight or molecular weight divided by the 'n' factor.
<!--SR:!2023-10-02,65,290-->
-  'n' factor for acids :: The amount of ionizable $H^+$ ions `per molecule` acid, this is also called the basicity of an acid
<!--SR:!2023-08-12,25,290-->
-  'n' factor of bases :: The amount of ionizable $OH^-$ ions `per molecule` of base, this is also called the acidity of the base
<!--SR:!2023-07-15,4,270-->
- 'n' Factor of a salt :: The total amount of positive or negative charge on the ions
<!--SR:!2023-07-14,3,250-->
-  'n' factor of an ion :: The charge on that ion
-  'n' factor of a redox reaction in a redox titration :: The 'n' factor for the reducing agent is the number of electrons lost
-  'n' factor of an oxidizing agent in a redox titration :: The 'n' factor for the oxidizing agent is the number of electrons gained
<!--SR:!2023-09-26,59,270-->

### Concentration terms
-  Molarity :: Amount of moles of solute per liter of solution
<!--SR:!2023-08-12,25,290-->
	-  Specific gravity to moles conversion :: (Specific Gravity * % strength * 10)/molecular wt.
<!--SR:!2023-09-05,38,270-->
	-  two solutions of the same solute are mixed, what is the molarity:: $\frac{m_1v_1+m_2v_2}{v_1+v_2}$
<!--SR:!2023-07-15,4,270-->
	-  Strength % (S) :: Weight of solute/volume of solution
<!--SR:!2023-07-26,8,230-->
	-  Is molarity temperature dependent :: Yes, due to molarity relying on the volume of the solution, it does depend on the temperature
<!--SR:!2023-09-07,40,270-->
-  Molality :: Number of moles per kilogram of solvent
<!--SR:!2023-08-07,20,250-->
	-  Does molality depend on the temperature of a solvent :: No molality is not temperature dependent due to the fact that it relies on the mass of the solvent, which is a value that does not change with temperature
<!--SR:!2023-08-10,23,270-->
-  Normality :: Number of Gram equivalents of solute per liter of solution
<!--SR:!2023-08-08,21,250-->
	-  specific gravity to normality  :: (specific gravity * % strength * 10)/equivalent weight
	-  If the normality of two solutions with the same solute is known, calculate the normality of their combination :: $\frac{N_1V_1+N_2V_2}{V_1+V_2}$
-  Mole fraction :: It is the number of moles of a component to number of moles of the solution, component goes for both the solute and solvent
	- Sum of all mole fractions of all components in a solution is equal to :: The sum of all the mole fractions of the components of a solution is always `1`
