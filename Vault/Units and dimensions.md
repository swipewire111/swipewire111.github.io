### Physical quantities
Physical quantities :: The quantities that can be measured by instruments and by means of which we can describe the laws of physics are physical quantities.
<!--SR:!2023-08-11,24,290-->
3 types of physical quantities :: Fundamental, derived, supplementary
<!--SR:!2023-07-15,4,270-->

Fundamental physical quantities ::7 of them exist,  Elementary quantities that span the entirety of physics,  any other physical quantity can be derived from these, all 7 of them are independent of each other
<!--SR:!2023-07-14,3,250-->

The 7 fundamental quantities :: Length, mass, time, electric current, amount of substance, temperature, luminous intensity

Derived quantities :: Can be expressed in the form of fundamental physical quantities

Supplementary quantities :: besides the 7 fundamental quantities, there are 2 supplementary quantities, plane angle and solid angle.
<!--SR:!2023-07-15,4,270-->

plane angle :: the angle subtended at the centre when the arc length is divided by the length of the radius.
<!--SR:!2023-07-15,4,270-->

solid angle :: the solid angle subtended at the centre of a sphere, when you divide the area by the square of the radius of the sphere.

### special features of dimensions

Rule of adding :: only substances of similar dimensions can be added or subtracted, but this rule does not apply to multiplication, only substances of similar dimensions can be subtracted and added to give rise to similar quantities.
<!--SR:!2023-08-14,27,290-->

Rule of dimensionless quantities :: the $\theta$ in $sin(\theta)$ is a dimensionless quantity just like all the angle values in the trigonometric equations and the trigonometric equations themselves, as well as the argument present in logarithmic functions, are all dimensionless.
