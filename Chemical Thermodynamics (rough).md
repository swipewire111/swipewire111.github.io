## Study of heat and other forms of energy is called chemical thermodynamics

## System and surroundings
- ### System - The part of the universe that is under observation
- ###  Surroundings - the remaining universe that is not the system
- ### Boundary - the real or imaginary boundary, line or surface that separates the surroundings from the system, can be diathermic (allow the passage of heat) or can be adiabatic (not allow the passage of heat)

## Types of systems
- ### open system - both flow of matter and energy is allowed
- ### closed system - matter cannot flow in and out of the system but energy can flow freely
- ### isolates system - where not matter nor energy can flow in and out of the system

# Macroscopic properties
- ### The properties of a system that arises from the collective behavior of a large amount of species is called macroscopic properties
## Types of macroscopic properties
- ### Intensive - Properties that are intensive do not depend on the quantity of matter
- ### Extensive - Properties that are extensive depend on the amount of matter
- ### the ratio of two extensive units are is always intensive
## State variables
- ### When a thermodynamic system is in a certain state all of its properties are constant, when you change on of the properties, the system changes, these quantifiable properties are called state variables
## State and path functions - 
- ### State functions are those functions that depend only on the state of a system and not the path it takes, IE  they depend only on the initial and final values
- ### Path functions are those functions that depend on the path takes IE, work and heat.
