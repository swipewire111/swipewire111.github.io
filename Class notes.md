### Chemistry
#### Chemical kinetics
$x$ = concentration of reactants spent in time $'T'$ 
#### Half life
- It's the time period in which, half of the reactant is reacted 
- half life$= \frac{[A]_0}{2K}$
- time of completion :: time after which the reactant is completely consumed
### characteristics of zero order reactions
- equal concentrations of reactants react in equal time
- reactions get completed in a definite time period
- concentration of reactants remaining after equal time period
